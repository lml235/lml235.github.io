                <p>The first recorded kingdom (Choson) on the Korean Peninsula dates from approximately <time datetime="2300">2300 B.C.</time> Over the subsequent centuries, three main kingdoms -- Kogoryo, Baekche, and Silla -- were established on the Peninsula. </p>

                <p>By the 5th century A.D., Kogoryo emerged as the most powerful, with control over much of the Peninsula and part of Manchuria (modern-day northeast China). However, Silla allied with the Chinese to create the first unified Korean state in <time datetime="0688">688</time>. Following the collapse of Silla in the 9th century, Korea was unified under the Koryo (Goryeo; <time datetime="0918">918</time>-<time datetime="1392">1392</time>) and the Chosen (Joseon; 1392-1910) dynasties.</p>
                
                <p>Korea became the object of intense imperialistic rivalry among the Chinese (its traditional benefactor), Japanese, and Russian empires in the latter half of the 19th and early 20th centuries. After the Sino-Japanese War (<time datetime="1894">1894</time>-<time datetime="1895">1895</time>) and the Russo-Japanese War (<time datetime="1904">1904</time>-<time datetime="1905">1905</time>), Korea was occupied by Imperial Japan. In <time datetime="1910">1910</time> Japan formally annexed the entire Peninsula. Korea regained its independence after Japan's surrender to the US and its allies in <time datetime="1945">1945</time>. </p>

                <p>A US-supported democratic government (Republic of Korea, <abbr>ROK</abbr>) was set up in the southern half of the Korean Peninsula, while a communist-style government backed by the Soviet Union was installed in the north (North Korea; aka Democratic People's Republic of Korea, <abbr>DPRK</abbr>). During the Korean War (<time datetime="1950">1950</time>-<time datetime="1953">1953</time>), US troops and UN forces fought alongside ROK soldiers to defend South Korea from a North Korean invasion supported by communist China and the Soviet Union. After the <time datetime="1953">1953</time> armistice, the two Koreas were separated by a demilitarized zone.</p>

                <p>Syngman RHEE led the country as its first president from <time datetime="1948">1948</time> to <time datetime="1960">1960</time>. PARK Chung-hee took over leadership of the country in a <time datetime="1961">1961</time> coup. During his controversial rule (<time datetime="1961">1961</time>-<time datetime="1979">1979</time>), South Korea achieved rapid economic growth, with per capita income rising to roughly 17 times the level of North Korea by <time datetime="1979">1979</time>. PARK was assassinated in <time datetime="1979">1979</time>, and subsequent years were marked by political turmoil and continued military rule as the country's pro-democracy movement grew. </p>

                <p>South Korea held its first free presidential election under a revised democratic constitution in <time datetime="1987">1987</time>, with former South Korean Army general ROH Tae-woo winning a close race. In <time datetime="1993">1993</time>, KIM Young-sam became the first civilian president of South Korea's new democratic era. President KIM Dae-jung (<time datetime="1998">1998</time>-<time datetime="2003">2003</time>) won the Nobel Peace Prize in <time datetime="2000">2000</time> for his contributions to South Korean democracy and his "Sunshine Policy" of engagement with North Korea. </p>

                <p>President PARK Geun-hye, daughter of former South Korean President PARK Chung-hee, took office in <time datetime="2013">2013</time> as South Korea's first female leader. In <time datetime="2016">2016</time>, the National Assembly passed an impeachment motion against PARK over her alleged involvement in a corruption and influence-peddling scandal, triggering an early presidential election in <time datetime="2017">2017</time> won by MOON Jae-in. In <time datetime="2022">2022</time>, longtime prosecutor and political newcomer YOON Suk Yeol won the presidency by the slimmest margin in South Korean history.</p>

                <p>Discord and tensions with North Korea, punctuated by North Korean military provocations, missile launches, and nuclear tests, have permeated inter-Korean relations for years. Relations remained strained, despite a period of respite in <time datetime="2018">2018</time>-<time datetime="2019">2019</time> ushered in by North Korea's participation in the <time datetime="2018">2018</time> Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games in South Korea and high-level diplomatic meetings, including historic US-North Korea summits. In <time datetime="2024">2024</time>, Pyongyang announced it was ending all economic cooperation with South Korea, a move that followed earlier proclamations that it was scrapping a <time datetime="2018">2018</time> military pact to de-escalate tensions along their militarized border, abandoning the country’s decades-long pursuit of peaceful unification with South Korea, and designating the South as North Korea’s “principal enemy.”</p>
